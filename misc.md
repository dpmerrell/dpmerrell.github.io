# Cycling 

**2016-04 -- 2016-08** I rode my bike from Rome to Edinburgh over the course of four months. I sometimes cheated and took the train, but then again I took a very circuitous route that went as far east as Budapest and Prague. [(Google Photos Album)](https://goo.gl/photos/9ZaJGTrX1ocAGx617)


# Hiking/Backpacking

**2017-07-03** While visiting family in Colorado, we climbed two "fourteeners".
