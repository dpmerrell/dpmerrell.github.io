For a variety of reasons, my undergrad left me feeling burnt out. By the time
I graduated, I had very little appetite for books. I was a little bit confused
by this, since I had always loved reading as I was growing up. "Not to worry", 
I said to my newly graduated self; "my appetite will return eventually."

It turns out I was right; after about two years, I regained my enjoyment of 
reading.
