Hygiene: practices that promote bodily health and prevent parasites/pathogens from taking residence.

Cognitive hygiene: practices that promote cognitive function and prevent maladaptive memes from occupying your mind.


Some categories of common parasitic memes:
* Strident political rhetoric
* Concept creep
* Conspiracy theorizing


Some cognitive-hygienic practices:
* Have a diverse and thoughtfully curated information diet.
    - Don't get too comfortable. Stay curious.
    - Learn what real expertise looks like.
        - Expertise is not equally valid across all subjects. 
            * XKCD about purity.
            * A physicist's expertise in physics carries more validity than a social psychologist's expertise in social psychology. This is because physics is on much firmer epistemic ground than any social science (and social psychology in particular). 
        - Roughly: a field lends itself to valid expertise, to the extent that it permits objective verification (e.g., experiments or mathematical proofs).
    - Try to have a basic idea of how the world works.
        * Learn some physical science
        * Learn some history, economics, and political science.
        * Have some idea of human nature. Talk to people, or even read classic novels.
* Practice saying "I don't know."
    - Get used to thinking in probabilities, shades of gray.
    - Even better: try thinking in bets.
        * Probability, plus skin in the game. How much money would you be willing to lose, if you were proven wrong?
        * form opinions that can be disproven by empirical observation.
* Try changing your mind once in a while.
    - Have thoughtful opinions, but _hold them loosely._[^3]
    - Alfred North Whitehead quote about thinking.
    - Charlie Munger quote about destroying your own ideas.
* Stay connected to empirical reality.
    - This principle showed up in some earlier points, but I want to highlight it with its own section.
    - Expertise is not equally valid across all subjects. 
    - Where do your opinions make empirically falsifiable claims? If your opinion cannot be falsified, then you are on thin ice. Nobody has any reason to take your opinion seriously.

# Some helpful quotes

> "The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, and wiser people so full of doubts."
> &mdash; Bertrand Russell[^1]

Charlie Munger quotes: work necessary to have an opinion

> "I never allow myself to have an opinion on anything that I don't know the other side's argument better than they do."
> &mdash; Charlie Munger

> "We all are learning, modifying, or destroying ideas all the time. Rapid destruction of your ideas when the time is right is one of the most valuable qualities you can acquire. You must force yourself to consider arguments on the other side."
> &mdash; Charlie Munger[^2]

> "The purpose of thinking is to let the ideas die instead of us dying."
> &mdash; Alfred North Whitehead

# Why am I writing this?

Today it seems harder to form a coherent picture of what's going on, than it did 10 years ago.

Widespread distrust of mainstream media and government institutions
* The troubling thing: all too often, the distrust is warranted

Strident, overly-confident rhetoric in our politics (on both sides).

Rampant spread of conspiracy theories, enabled by the internet.
