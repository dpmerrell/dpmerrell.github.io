I've been in graduate school for a couple of months now. Given that I'm 
pursuing a PhD, I've barely even begun my graduate studies. However,
I've already become aware that I am inside a flawed system. I have
mixed feelings about this, and I'll attempt to work them out in this
post. I doubt that I'm the first graduate student to make these observations,
but experiencing them in the first person has given me some unease.

As a teaching assistant, I am kept very busy with grading, office hours,
and leading "discussion sessions" (I walk through practice problems
with groups of ~30 students a couple of times a week). In total, it 
amounts to about 20 hours per week. I really enjoy my TA 
responsibilities---with the exception of grading, 
which tends to be tedious. Helping people understand things gives me 
a lot of satisfaction. I put effort into this because I want 
to do a good job.

Here's where my unease comes from: as a PhD student, I am in graduate school
to do research. In order to start doing research, I have to prove my abilities
to faculty in some way (e.g. the independent study course that I'm doing right
now). However, making progress in research takes time and effort. Given that I 
have coursework and TA responsibilities, it's hard to make the progress that
I would like to. So I'm locked in this sort of "chicken-and-egg" situation
where my current circumstances make it difficult to change my circumstances.

Graduate TAs aren't the only ones who experience this sort of dynamic.
Junior faculty have a similar---and more intense---experience as they seek 
tenure. Their job
security depends on their ability to publish articles, 
but they are also given teaching responsibilities that could potentially
interfere with their research.

What it boils down to: PhD students and junior faculty are ultimately 
measured by one attribute (publication history), but they are given 
responsibilities over a variety of things (undoubtedly, this single-minded
focus on publication stems from the school's dependence on research grants
for funding. Why should a school pay for its professors or PhD students when
NSF/DARPA/DOE/etc. can?). It's unacceptable for them to shirk those additional 
responsibilities, but those additional responsibilities are not really 
accounted for when judging the progress or worthiness of a graduate student
or would-be tenured professor. 

In this situation, the "rational" thing to do is to spend as little time as
possible in fulfilling the additional responsibilities, devoting the remainder
to research. This might result in lackluster educational outcomes, but faculty 
get to keep their jobs and PhD students make "satisfactory progress". The 
"irrational" thing to do is to put effort into teaching; to provide a quality
educational experience for students. Grad students are not judged by their 
teaching quality. TAs are penalized for doing good work.

This post could probably be summarized by that last sentence. As someone who
tries to do a good job in teaching, I think I'm being penalized.
Truthfully, I don't think I'll need to worry about this much longer; my 
independent study course is going okay, and I think I'll be able to 
work as an RA in the near future. But is this a necessary experience to have?
Is it a necessary part of higher education?
