It's commonly understood that grad students are poor.

This is factually incorrect for the vast majority of grad students at Wisconsin.
[The poverty line for a household of 1 is about $13k](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/medicaid/fpl.htm),
which is [slightly below UW-Madison's minimum pay for a 33% teaching assistantship](https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/03/taa-continues-the-fight-for-fair-treatment-under-act-10).
Very few grad students meet the definition of poverty,
and most receive [annual stipends closer to $20k](https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/03/taa-continues-the-fight-for-fair-treatment-under-act-10).
  
A person can live quite comfortably on a $20k stipend in Madison, WI. 
But doing so requires _a modicum of planning and self control_.

So let's put aside conventional beliefs about poor grad students.
I've never felt poor in grad school. It seems totally avoidable.
Humor me as I lay out my strategies, bearing in mind that I'm a childless bachelor with relatively few responsibilities.


## Managing Expenses

Some common ways people burn money; and how they can stop

* Rent
* Transportation
* Food
* "Stuff"; material possessions
    - Clothing
    - Gadgets; consumer electronics
    - Gaming (big-title games, at least)
* Recreation
    - Reading and writing
    - Working out; exercise
    - Hiking; camping
    - House parties
    - Some kinds of art: painting, music
    - Going out for dinner or drinks on occasion 


## Putting Your Money to Work

First: pay off debts
* "Snowball" strategy: focus on the debt with highest interest rate; then move on to the next-highest; and so on.
* Only move on to investing if you have no remaining debts with interest rate > 0%.
* You can think of a debt as a "negative investment" that has zero volatility.
  Clearing it away quickly is the right idea!


Investing for grad students
* Get a Roth IRA and make full contributions every year
* What assets should I buy?
    - Keep it simple. Default should be to "match the market".
      Only deviate from that if you have a good reason.
    - Index funds and ETFs can help with this. In effect, they allow you to buy shares in the entire market, weighted by value.
    - On that note: young people are usually better off with a portfolio heavily weighted toward stocks.
      Stocks tend to be more volatile than bonds, for example.
      But they tend to have higher returns, and you can afford to take some risks when you're young.
    - Use ETFs and index funds to diversify yourself over broad swaths of the market.


Golden age of investing for private individuals
* Many services offer brokerage accounts with no fees or transaction costs.
* Roboadvisors like Wealthfront or Schwab Intelligent Porfolios can help you maintain discipline.
    - I used one for a while, but ultimately wasn't very impressed by it.
    - A simple S&P500 index reliably outperformed it across various market conditions.
