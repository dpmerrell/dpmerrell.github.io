## Introduction

This post is sort of an "opinion" piece. 
It airs some of my discontent regarding modern computer usage.
I don't expect everyone to identify with my frustration, but 
I can't imagine I'm the only person feeling this way.

TL;DR: 

+ I feel that humans should be engaged in self-improvement;

+ I claim that computers and smart phones, all too often, hinder our self-improvement
  (and, in fact, make us worse humans);

+ I attempt to grasp the economic reasons for things to be this way;

+ I argue that the relationship between humans and computers can
change for the better; and that this is in the long-term best interest
for corporations (and consumers).

## Human Flourishing

*I want to be strong, not weak.* \\
*I want to be smart, not stupid.* \\
*I want to be informed, not ignorant.* \\
*I want to be kind, not mean.* \\
*I want to be connected, not isolated.* \\
*I want to be dependable, not flaky.* \\
*I want to be generous, not stingy* \\
*I want satisfaction, not regret.*

The best definition of hell: at the end of your life, 
to meet the person you could have become.

## We Are Our Habits

"Habit" and "identity" are closely related. 
The idea is conveyed in the following quotes:

> "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit." \\
   ---Aristotle

> "Men's natures are alike; it is their habits that separate them." \\
   ---Confucius

> "Your beliefs become your thoughts, \\
   Your thoughts become your words, \\
   Your words become your actions, \\
   Your actions become your habits, \\
   Your habits become your values, \\
   Your values become your destiny." \\
   ---Gandhi; various other attributions

I find this idea to be useful.
The notion of "who we are" can be abstract and immeasurable; 
but "what we repeatedly do" is concrete and observable.
Under this premise, the poorly-defined task of *self-improvement* 
translates to *habit-improvement*---which is easier to think
about. 

## Good and Bad Habits 

Certainly, some habits are better than others; 
some promote flourishing and satisfaction while others 
lead to disfunction and regret. We can filter good habits
from bad ones by answering questions like:

## Habits from Modern Computing

Compulsive internet use

Compulsive phone use

## Computers Should Help Us, and not Hinder Us

Intentional computing research

Browser plugins

## Problematic Incentives

Social media sites earn revenue on advertisements

Their advertising value is proportional to traffic on their site

Hence, social media sites are incentivized to be addictive.

## A Possible Solution

Offer a paid subscription with no advertisements and a design that
is delightful, but not addicting (e.g., get rid of the continuous 
scroll activity digest on facebook). Or make the design configurable to user 
preference (they can have the scrolling activity digest if they
really want it).
