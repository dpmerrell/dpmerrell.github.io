\begin{abstract}
  Weighted model counting and integration (\abr{WMC}/\abr{WMI}) are natural
  problems to which we can reduce many probabilistic
  inference tasks, e.g., in Bayesian networks, Markov networks,
  and probabilistic programs.
  Typically, we are given a first-order formula,
  where each satisfying assignment is associated
  with a weight---e.g., a probability
  of occurrence---and our goal is to compute
  the total weight of the formula.
  % To handle richer domains, researchers from different
  % communities have also recently started tackling the
  % \emph{weighted model integration} (\abr{WMI}) problem,
  % where formulas are over infinite domains, e.g.,
  % real arithmetic.
  In this paper, we target \emph{exact inference} techniques
  for \abr{WMI} that leverage the power of \emph{satisfiability
  modulo theories} (\abr{SMT}) solvers to decompose
  a first-order formula in \emph{linear real arithmetic} into
  a set of \emph{hyperrectangular regions} whose
  weight is easy to compute.
  We demonstrate the challenges of hyperrectangular
  decomposition and present a novel technique
  that utilizes \emph{orthogonal transformations}
  to transform \abr{SMT} formulas in order
  to enable efficient inference.
  Our evaluation demonstrates our technique's ability
  to improve the time required to achieve exact
  probability bounds.

\section{Conclusion}
We addressed weighted model integration (\abr{WMI})
algorithms that decompose a linear arithmetic
formula into a set of disjoint hyperrectangular regions.
We argued that the hyperrectangular decomposition approach benefits from applying transformations on formulas,
and showed how to to construct orthogonal transformations over rationals,
preserving the independence of Gaussian variables without introducing irrational coefficients. 
%so as to avoid introducing numerical errors and preserve weight.
We implemented and evaluated our approach, demonstrating
the substantial improvements available through orthogonal transformations.
As a result, downstream applications such as repair and synthesis
\cite{cavsynthesis} are improved.
