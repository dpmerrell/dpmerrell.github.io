_Yet another nerd's take on ChatGPT/stable diffusion/etc._

The thoughts in this post had been swirling in my head for a couple of weeks, but sort of _congealed_ today while I listened to [this EconTalk episode.](https://www.econtalk.org/ian-leslie-on-being-human-in-the-age-of-ai/)

* I theorize there are multiple kinds of creativity.
    - Combinatorial creativity: combining existing concepts in a way that hasn't been done before. (Relatively common.)
        * Example: Harry Potter fan fiction.
    - Original creativity: generating novel concepts. (Much rarer.)
        * Example: inventing the Harry Potter universe.
    - (In truth I think the reality is more complicated. The difference between "combinatorial" and "original" creativity seems like one of _abstraction level_, rather than _kind_. I.e., all new things come about from new configurations of atoms, but a creative person usually works at a higher level of abstraction than atoms.)
* The creativity shown by generative models (ChatGPT, stable diffusion, Dall-E, etc.) falls almost completely in the "combinatorial creativity" bucket.
    - Modern deep neural networks are essentially _interpolators_. In many cases they _literally_ interpolate their training sets.
    - Abstractly, concepts can be regarded as points in a high-dimensional space. A generative AI is trained on data that induce a point cloud in this space. 
    - Those points from the dataset have a convex hull. Current generative models seem to do a great job of interpolating within that convex hull. This is, by itself, an impressive and valuable achievement (to say the least). A ton of economic and human value comes from fleshing out that convex hull, finding new combinations of ideas that make our lives better and more interesting. 
    - What's less clear is how well they can generate points outside of that convex hull. It's rare even for humans to do that.

From this perspective, what can knowledge-workers or creatives do to maximize their comparative advantage against AI?

* Pay attention to your environment. If you do encounter a novel concept, it will probably arise from some kind of interaction between you and your physical or social surroundings. This is your best chance at punching through that convex hull.
* Embrace weirdness. You have something unique to contribute. Let the world see it!
* Avoid being too predictable. De-correlate your thinking from that of other people. If I can predict your thoughts, words and actions from simple labels ("democrat", "republican", "religious", "irreligious", etc.) then you're unlikely to provide any alpha to society. 
* Find ways to harness AI to enhance productivity.
* There's still room for a human touch. It helps to be a pleasant person to be around.
