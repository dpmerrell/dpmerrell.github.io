_Yet another nerd's take on ChatGPT/stable diffusion/etc._

Credit where it's due: this post took much inspiration from [today's EconTalk episode.](https://www.econtalk.org/ian-leslie-on-being-human-in-the-age-of-ai/) 

* I theorize there are multiple kinds of creativity.
    - Combinatorial creativity: combining existing concepts in a way that hasn't been done before. **(Relatively common.)** 
        * Example: Harry Potter fan fiction.
    - Original creativity: generating novel concepts. **(Much rarer.)**
        * Example: inventing the Harry Potter universe.
    - (In truth, I think the reality is more complicated. Creativity is probably more of a continuous scale than a dichotomy.)
* The creativity shown by generative models (ChatGPT, stable diffusion, Dall-E, etc.) falls almost completely in the "combinatorial creativity" bucket.
    - Modern deep neural networks are essentially _interpolators_. In many cases they _literally_ interpolate their training sets.
    - Abstractly, concepts can be regarded as points in a high-dimensional space. A generative AI is trained on data that induce a point cloud in this space. In some sense, those points have a convex hull.
    - Current generative models seem to do a great job of interpolating at points inside that convex hull. This is, by itself, an impressive and valuable achievement (to say the least). 
    - What's less clear is how well they can generate points outside of that convex hull. It's rare even for humans to do that.

From this perspective, what can knowledge-workers or creatives do to maximize their comparative advantage against AIs?

* Embrace weirdness. You have something unique to contribute. Let the world see it!
* Pay attention to your environment. If you do encounter a novel concept, it will probably arise from some kind of interaction between you and your physical or social surroundings.
* Avoid being too predictable. De-correlate your thinking from that of other people. If I can predict what you'll say next, then an AI certainly can. 
* Find ways to harness AIs to enhance productivity.
