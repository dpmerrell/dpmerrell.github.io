I'm bothered by some of the media's breathless, creduluous coverage of recent events in fusion research.
People are too excited; they're taking away incorrect conclusions.

[This article from _Science_ is one of the better ones I've seen on the subject.](https://www.science.org/content/article/historic-explosion-long-sought-fusion-breakthrough)

What are the facts?

* NIF uses an inertial confinement reactor. It shoots lasers at a pellet of fuel and measures the energy output. 
* In a recent NIF experiment, lasers shot ~2 MJ of energy into a fuel pellet. About 3 MJ came out.
* The lasers themselves required **hundreds of MJ** to operate during that single shot.
* This most recent experiment is the culmination of many similar NIF experiments in recent years.
  Its success resulted from (a) incremental improvements to the fuel pellet design and (b) a slight increase in power for the lasers.

What's bothering me?

* The fact that the reaction is _not_ self-sustaining has not been given enough attention.
  A lot of people I talk to seem to have missed that crucial detail. 
  I don't blame those people for missing it; but I do blame journalists for not giving it more prominence in their coverage. 
* People keep calling this "revolutionary," or a "breakthrough." To me it seems more like an exciting&mdash;though fundamentally **incremental**&mdash;improvement in inertial confinement fusion.
* I've heard some people say that this experiment is an existence proof that controlled fusion is possible.
  However, I don't think anybody seriously doubted it was possible in the first place.
  The physics was never in doubt; it has always been fundamentally an engineering problem.
  And _most_ of the engineering challenges remain unsolved.
* A lot of the excitement seems misplaced, given that economically viable fusion energy is unlikely to come from an inertial confinement reactor. Most experts consider magnetic confinement devices (e.g., tokamaks or stellarators) much more promising for attaining self-sustaining fusion. I doubt that the technological lessons learned at NIF will be of any help in improving magnetic confinement designs.
* Some people say public excitement about these advances is a good thing, since it will result in increased funding for fusion research.
  That may be true. 
  But if we still don't have commercial fusion reactors in 10 or 20 years, tax-payers and investors may become resentful.
  That funding could quickly disappear if people feel that the researchers oversold and underdelivered. 

I voice these concerns as somebody who is a big fan of fusion research.
I wish it had more funding.
But I don't think the discussion around recent events has been very honest.
