In this post I'll list some of the mental models I employ when I think about graduate school.

## Opportunity Cost

This is my most significant consideration.
A PhD in computer science requires roughly six years' work. 
What else could I accomplish with six years?

In a parallel universe, my situation might look like this: 

- _Income_: perhaps as much as $500k earned over the course of six years.
            My salary at the six-year mark&mdash;after six years' work experience&mdash;could match 
            that of a newly-minted PhD.
- _Skills_: as a software engineer, I would be required to learn a variety
    of practical skills on a continual basis&mdash;languages, libraries, frameworks, etc. 
    Each of these things increases my productivity and value.
- _Roles and responsibilities_: It seems possible that I could move into
    a managerial role within six years of work. I tend to work hard and seek responsibility.
- _Personal life_: as a grad student, I feel compelled to devote most of my 
   waking hours to research or coursework. I most likely wouldn't feel this way about
   my employment. So my parallel universe-self probably has more time for hobbies, 
   personal projects, relationships, etc.

This simple vision serves as a powerful baseline of comparison.
Graduate studies come at a real cost.

My reflexive response to it is actually one of motivation, though.
I think of the experiences of my parallel universe-self,
and it motivates me to get the most out of my own time in grad school.

It also motivates me to seek some of those experiences _as a grad student_.
Some examples: 

* I got involved in [SACM](https://sacm.cs.wisc.edu/) in order to hone my management and leadership skills.
  I ended up being president and getting a lot done. Very rewarding.
* I try to make sure I'm constantly learning new concepts, and ways of doing things.
  I try not to settle for the skills I already have. 
  I try to pay attention to new developments in the practice of ML and software engineering.
* I have even spent some time exploring new hobbies.
  I joined [Wisconsin's club triathlon team](https://www.facebook.com/WisconsinTriTeam/) last year and really got into training.
  I competed in some Olympic-distance races.
  I wasn't the best, but I had a lot of fun and fully intend to get back into triathlons once I've graduated.
  (I've backed off on the training this year&mdash;devoting more time to research.)

If I find myself growing lax, all I have to do is think of my parallel universe-self.
My choice to get a PhD is a proactive one, and I intend to make the most of it.
I'm not here to screw around.
