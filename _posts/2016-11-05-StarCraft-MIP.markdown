I'm taking a course in optimization this semester. It includes a project.

I've always been kind of fascinated by real-time strategy games from 
a theoretical standpoint. Growing up I was never very good at playing them, but they
captured my imagination. Players face an immense decision space; it's clear
that there are good and bad choices to take, but trying to identify the 
*best* choice always seemed kind of unobtainable.

About 1.5 years ago, I got the idea in my head to try making an AI for StarCraft.
I tried using the StarCraft Brood War API, but the project eventually fell to the 
wayside as I (a) realized the scale of that project and (b) got distracted by
other things.

With these prior experiences in mind, I decided to tackle one particular aspect of StarCraft for my optimization project---
early game build orders. I'll try to answer this question: what choices maximize 
military strength within the first few minutes of play? This is useful to know,
whether you're trying to rush your opponent or defend yourself from a rush.

[Anyways, here's a link to my proposal.]({{site.url}}/assets/coursework/dmerrell-proposal.pdf)
Hopefully it gets approved and I can get to work on it.

Note: Interestingly, Google's DeepMind and Blizzard Entertainment made 
[a relevant announcement yesterday](https://deepmind.com/blog/deepmind-and-blizzard-release-starcraft-ii-ai-research-environment/). 
They're collaborating to open StarCraft II as a testbed for AI research.
I couldn't agree more with their reasoning that real-time strategy games are an
excellent environment for agent design.
