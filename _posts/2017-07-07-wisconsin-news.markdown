Our algorithmic fairness group has been blessed with fame and riches.

A few days ago, this article went up on the University of Wisconsin main
webpage: 

[UW-Madison researchers tackle bias in algorithms](http://news.wisc.edu/uw-madison-researchers-tackle-bias-in-algorithms/)

I'm proud of myself for not looking dumb in the photo, or sounding dumb
in my quote.

(*edit 2017-07-10: Our research also got featured on the front page of
the Wisconsin State Journal:*

*[UW software aims to find and fix biased computer programs](http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/uw-software-aims-to-find-and-fix-biased-computer-programs/article_7f261c21-a107-5841-92b6-9ffbd69eca9a.html)*

*Wisconsin State Journal gives scant attention to grad students; e.g., 
Sam Drews is not mentioned at all.*)

So that's the aforementioned "fame". The "riches" refer to a $1M NSF grant
awarded to my advisor, Aws Albarghouthi. My research will be funded with 
this grant; I am very grateful to Aws and the NSF for this opportunity.
