Our algorithmic fairness group has been blessed with fame and riches.

A few days ago, this article went up on the University of Wisconsin main
webpage: 

[UW-Madison researchers tackle bias in algorithms](http://news.wisc.edu/uw-madison-researchers-tackle-bias-in-algorithms/)

I'm proud of myself for not looking dumb in the photo, or sounding dumb
in my quote.

So that's the aforementioned "fame". The "riches" refer to a $1M NSF grant
awarded to my advisor, Aws Albarghouthi, a couple of months ago.
My research will be funded with 
this grant; I am very grateful to Aws and the NSF for this opportunity.
