Some assertions stated without proof&mdash;or even argument: 

* We can think of two kinds of suffering: 
    1. the unavoidable suffering inherent to life; and
    2. unnecessary suffering.
* Most of the unnecessary suffering we experience results from _stupidity_, rather than _evil intention_.
    - (See [Hanlon's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor))
* Most of the unnecessary suffering experienced by most people, is _self-inflicted_.

It follows that most of the time, the reduction of suffering consists of _ceasing from stupid behaviors_.

If someone is suffering, then they should ask themselves:

* _What bullshit stories am I telling myself?_
* _What incorrect assumptions do I take for granted?_
* _What responsibilities have I been avoiding?_
