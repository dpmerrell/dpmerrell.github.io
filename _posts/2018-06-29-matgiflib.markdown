Some observations:

* Among python programmers, Matplotlib is the dominant package for visualizing information. It is powerful in the hands of skilled users. 

* Matplotlib is only able to make static plots.

* Much of the time, information is best visualized in _animation_.

* On the web, GIFs have become a very popular mode of animation.

In light of these observations, I have built a python package which extends matplotlib to create GIFs.

My guiding philosophy was to interfere as little as possible with typical Matplotlib programming patterns. Matplotlib expertise gets the programmer 99% of the way to making nice GIFs.

There are still improvements to make, but the code is publicly available on Github:
