I read [G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach](https://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567/ref=sr_1_1?crid=33V4Y3VNINHAL&dchild=1&keywords=godel+escher+bach&qid=1617814499&sprefix=godel+escher+bach%2Caps%2C399&sr=8-1) (GEB) a few years ago. I still think of it from time to time.

I think there are good and bad reasons to read this book.

Good reasons:
* It's an exquisite, mind-bending work of art.
  The kind of person who enjoys Escher or Bach may also enjoy GEB.
* It covers many topics in an entertaining and interesting way.
  Formal systems, molecular biology, etc.
* I really enjoyed it as a meditation on _metaphor_. 
  You could say the whole book is a metaphor. 

Bad reasons:
* You're looking for useful ideas about artificial intelligence.
* You're looking for deep connections between G&ouml;del's incompleteness theorem and human cognition.
  Douglas Hofstadter is happy to provide those connections, but it strikes me as fanciful thinking. 
  Good fiction, bad description of reality.

The book was a slog to get through, despite being entertaining at times.
I took about a month to read it---most of a winter break.  
It occupied most of my waking attention during that time.

I think GEB _does_ serve as a social signal among computer scientists and mathematicians. 
"I am very sophisticated for having read this book."
Am I engaging in signaling by writing this post?
I leave this as an exercise to the reader.

The book sometimes comes up in conversation with nerdy company---fellow CS grad students, for example.
It isn't uncommon for someone to tell me they read it in high school.
"Oh, great," I think to myself. "I wonder what you could have gotten out of it."

Ultimately, I think the payoff from reading GEB probably isn't worth the investment of time and effort for most people.
