I read [G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach](https://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567/ref=sr_1_1?crid=33V4Y3VNINHAL&dchild=1&keywords=godel+escher+bach&qid=1617814499&sprefix=godel+escher+bach%2Caps%2C399&sr=8-1) (GEB) a few years ago. I still think of it from time to time.

I think there are good and bad reasons to read this book.

Good reasons:
* It's an exquisite, mind-bending work of art.
  The kind of person who enjoys Escher or Bach will also enjoy GEB.
* It covers many topics in an entertaining and interesting way.
  Formal systems, molecular biology, etc.
* I really enjoyed it as a meditation on _metaphor_. 
  You could say the whole book is a metaphor. 

Bad reasons:
* You're looking for concrete, useful ideas about artificial intelligence.
* You're looking for deep connections between G&ouml;del's incompleteness theorem and human cognition.
  Douglas Hoffstadter is happy to provide those connections, but it strikes me as fanciful thinking. 
  Good fiction, bad description of reality.

The book was kind of a slog to get through.
I read it during a winter break, devoting much of my attention to it over a month or so.

I think GEB _does_ serve as a social signal among computer scientists and mathematicians. 
"I am very sophisticated for having read this book."
You could say I'm doing that by writing this post.

While I was reading GEB, I would sometimes mention it to acquaintances---fellow CS grad students.
It wasn't uncommon for someone to tell me they had read it in high school.
"Oh, great," I wondered to myself. "I wonder what you could have gotten out of it."

In my opinion, the investment of time and effort to read GEB probably won't pay off for most people.
