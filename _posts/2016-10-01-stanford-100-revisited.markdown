The first homework assignment for the Intro to AI class ended up
being an essay. We were each tasked with writing a 500-600 word 
critique of the Stanford AI100 article. In the end, I decided not
to try critiquing the article on any technical basis; I didn't
feel qualified to do that. Rather, I decided to focus on some aspects
of the article's scope. Here's the result:

>The Stanford AI100 Study seeks to record and influence the impact of artificial
intelligence in a series of articles over the course of 100 years. This 
ambitious endeavor is overseen by a Standing Committee who periodically select 
a Study Panel and charge them with the task of producing a written article. 
The first Study Panel--appointed in 2015--recently published the very first 
installment of this series in a report titled “Artificial Intelligence and 
Life in 2030”. Its scope is to describe the opportunities and challenges 
that may arise from AI in the next fifteen years, restricted to society in 
North American cities. Given the uncertainty inherent to technological 
advancement and the universality of AI’s significance for humanity, the 
Standing Committee's framing choices are overly speculative and 
overly parochial.

>The Study Panel’s mission to anticipate the status of technology in 2030 is 
misguided, given the uncertainty inherent to technological progress. Most 
technological advancement is accounted for by unexpected, improbable
discoveries; “black swan” events, as Nassim Taleb calls them. As such, 
there are strong limitations on anyone’s ability to predict technological 
progress. To the Study Panel’s credit, they don’t ever seem to let this 
forecasting requirement guide their analyses in any concrete way; every 
reference they make to the year 2030 could easily be replaced by a more 
conservative reference to “the near future”. However, the fact that the 
Standing Committee framed the report in this way suggests an unfounded optimism
in the Study Panel’s ability to forecast technological advancement. It would
be more honest to frame future AI100 reports in a way that emphasizes assessing
the current state and identifying immediate opportunities, rather than 
attempting forecasts ten or more years into the future.

>The report’s restriction to North American cities unnecessarily limits its 
perspective; it reflects the homogeneity of the Standing Committee and Study 
Panel. Artificial intelligence poses opportunities for all of mankind, and 
challenges all of mankind with important questions. It is important to avoid 
parochialism when surveying its implications. The provincialism of the first 
report is undoubtedly related to the homogeneous composition of the people 
involved. Five of six Standing Committee members are Americans; the sixth is 
Canadian. Furthermore, fourteen of seventeen Study Panel members are current 
long-term residents of the US; the fifteenth is Canadian. None of them are from 
East Asia or continental Europe. Developing regions, such as Africa or South 
America, have no representation. It is unclear whether the Study Panel was 
appointed before or after the scope was specified; whatever the case, the 
Standing Committee’s choices centered myopically on their own piece of the 
world. While there is some rationale for starting small and “sticking to what 
you know”, there is also risk associated with homogeneous perspective. It 
blinds the group to “unknown unknowns”, increasing the fragility of its work 
with respect to unforeseen contingencies.

>“Artificial Intelligence and Life in 2030” is only the first of many
AI100 reports, and the next will likely be more global in scope. However,
it was disappointing to see the first report framed in such an awkward 
fashion---culturally narrow and temporally distant. The Standing Committee 
ought to frame future reports in a more universal fashion and ought to appoint 
more heavily diversified Study Panels to write them. This may require the 
Standing Committee to form new connections, with people who are unfamiliar to 
them. However, if AI advancement is of fundamental importance, 
and if the Stanford AI100 Study wishes to provide authoritative guidance in 
this field, then it is crucial for the Standing Committee to avoid tunnel
vision or unproductive speculation as it frames these studies.
