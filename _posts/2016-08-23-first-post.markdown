This post is more of a test than anything---A blog
has to start somehow. The hope is that this blog
will evolve into something useful and interesting
over time.

As someone who studied mathematics and physics as
an undergraduate, my acquisition of computer 
skills has been extracurricular and haphazard.
It's a good way to learn, though I occasionally 
become painfully aware of gaping holes in my knowledge
base. 

The "gaping hole" on my mind right now is web development;
front end development in particular. I've been aware of 
HTML, JavaScript and CSS for a long while. I've read about frameworks
like Backbone and Angular. But I've *done* almost nothing in
this sphere.

Today I took a small step into the world of web development
by making this blog on [Github Pages](https://github.io). The [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) 
blogging framework is favorable to code monkeys; it liberates them
from the GUIfied coddling of Blogger and its ilk (this is important,
as coders *need* to feel smugly superior to their less computer literate
peers. I know this, because I'm typing this in vi). At the same time, 
the blogger isn't left completely comfortless---a variety of plugins 
enable the features one should expect in a modern blog (e.g. comments).
Furthermore, when a Jekyll blog is hosted on Github, it can serve as
advertisement for the blogger's other work. 

Today I fiddled with Google's [custom search engine](https://cse.google.com/cse/)
service, hoping that it will make my site searchable (I guess I optimistically
assume that I will be writing many posts). 
It doesn't seem to yield anything yet, but that may be because 
my blog is too empty for Google to index its contents.

Future posts will actually cover problems that I'm working
on, or reading that I'm trying to digest. Little by little,
it will be more useful to me (and perhaps more interesting 
to the reader)\\( \blacksquare \\)
