I have been negligent in my blogging. But I have been busy, so I don't
feel too bad. 

One of the more interesting things that's happened to me in the past seven months
is my advisors and I getting a paper accepted to the 
[International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI)](https://www.ijcai.org). 
Very exciting! I will be attending the 
[conference (in Melbourne, Australia)](http://www.ijcai-17.org), toward the end of August.

It's related to work mentioned in previous posts, about 
Symbolic Volume Integration (in the paper, we call it Weighted Model
Integration). We worked out a way to make our method
converge more efficiently. 

It's kind of neat---it relies on QR-factorization, Givens rotations,
and Pythagorean triples. It encounters some fundamental principles
of probability, i.e., the Skitovitch-Darmois Theorem.
