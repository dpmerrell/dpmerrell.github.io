title: Mental Models

I often find myself thinking in metaphors.
It's no surprise; I wager most people use metaphors to conceptualize their world, most of the time.
I can trace most of my own metaphors back to topics I've encountered in my studies:
math, science, and engineering.
I'm listing some of them here in an effort to clarify my own thinking.

I have to give credit to the excellent [Farnam Street blog](https://fs.blog/mental-models/)
for inspiring me to do this.
Farnam Street's founder, Shane Parrish, refers to these metaphors as _mental models_.
I attempt to provide a list of mental models that either 
(a) aren't already covered on Farnam Street, or 
(b) aren't articulated on Farnam Street _to my satisfaction_.
