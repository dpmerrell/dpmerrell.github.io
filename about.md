I work as a computational biologist in the [Getz Lab](https://getzlab.org/) at [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/).

I earned a PhD in [Computer Science\[s\]](http://cs.wisc.edu) at University of Wisconsin - Madison. 
I was fortunate to be advised by [Tony Gitter](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~gitter/).

Some topics that interest me:

* Bayesian machine learning for systems biology and cancer applications.
* Machine learning on non-i.i.d. data: sequences, hierarchies, networks.
* Machine learning on high-dimensional data with few samples.
* Probabilistic programming.
* Bayesian inference methods.

At the beginning of grad school, I spent some time in [programming languages research](https://madpl.cs.wisc.edu).

I studied math and physics as an undergrad. 
This background provided a solid foundation for my career.
Since then, I've done a lot of catching up in CS and biology.

I hope this blog evolves into something useful and interesting.
