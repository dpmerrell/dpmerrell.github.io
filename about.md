I am a [Computer Science\[s\]](http://cs.wisc.edu) PhD student at University of Wisconsin - Madison. 

I am advised by [Tony Gitter](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~gitter/).
Broadly speaking, we work in computational biology.

Some questions and topics that interest me:

* How do we extract useful insights from experimental data in extremely complicated settings?
* Machine learning beyond i.i.d. data: sequences, hierarchies, networks.
* Machine learning on small datasets, or in other settings where deep learning isn't viable.
* Connections between computation and statistics.
* Bayesian inference methods.
* Probabilistic programming.

At the beginning of grad school, I spent some time in [programming languages research](https://www.facebook.com/uwmadpl/).

As an undergrad I studied math and physics. This background has 
its benefits, though I had a lot of catching up to do in CS.

I hope this blog evolves into something useful and interesting.
