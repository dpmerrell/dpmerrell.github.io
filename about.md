I am pursuing a PhD in [Computer Science(s)](http://cs.wisc.edu) at University of Wisconsin---Madison. 
I am generously advised by [Aws Albarghouthi](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~aws/) and [Loris D'Antoni](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~loris/) of the 
[madPL group.](https://www.facebook.com/uwmadpl/) 

In our research we apply *program  verification* techniques to machine learning algorithms; 
e.g., neural networks. 
We aim to help practitioners build safe, reliable, and *ethical* machine learning systems.

I studied math and physics as an undergrad. This background has 
its benefits, though I've had a lot of catching up to do in CS.

I hope this blog evolves into something useful and interesting.
