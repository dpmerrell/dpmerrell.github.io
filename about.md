I am a [Computer Science\[s\]](http://cs.wisc.edu) PhD student at University of Wisconsin - Madison. 

I work in computational biology, advised by [Tony Gitter](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~gitter/).

Some topics that interest me:

* Machine learning on non-i.i.d. data: sequences, hierarchies, networks.
* Machine learning on high-dimensional data with few samples.
* Machine learning for systems biology applications.
* Probabilistic programming.
* Bayesian inference methods.

At the beginning of grad school, I spent some time in [programming languages research](https://madpl.cs.wisc.edu).

I studied math and physics as an undergrad. This background has 
its benefits, though I've done a lot of catching up in CS.

I hope this blog evolves into something useful and interesting.
