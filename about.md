I am pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at 
University of Wisconsin - Madison. 
I've found that I usually learn a principle best 
by teaching it. This blog gives me an outlet to 
explain topics that I encounter in my coursework, 
research, and life. It definitely benefits me, and
it may benefit you!

I am interested in many things, though I am early in my graduate studies and
haven't settled on a research topic. I do enjoy thinking about
cognition and decision making in systems of computers and humans. We'll
see where that gets me.

My background is in applied mathematics, with a tilt toward computational
simulation.
