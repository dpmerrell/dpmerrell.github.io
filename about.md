I am a [Computer Science(s)](http://cs.wisc.edu) graduate student at University of Wisconsin -- Madison. 

I consistently find myself dwelling on these topics:

* The capacity for computers to make us smarter---through optimization, machine learning, and AI.

* The capacity for computers to make us stupider---through distraction and low-quality information. 

* Probability, statistics, and information theory.

I have also dabbled in [programming languages research](https://www.facebook.com/uwmadpl/).

I studied math and physics as an undergrad. This background has 
its benefits, though I've had a lot of catching up to do in CS.

I hope this blog evolves into something useful and interesting.
