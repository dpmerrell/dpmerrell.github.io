I am pursuing a PhD in Computer Science(s) at 
University of Wisconsin - Madison. I hope that this
blog evolves into something useful and interesting.

I am generously advised by Aws Albarghouthi and Loris D'Antoni of the 
Programming Languages group. My research seeks to apply *program 
verification* techniques to machine learning algorithms; e.g., neural
networks. Our research aims to help practitioners build
safe, reliable, and *ethical* machine learning systems.

I studied math and physics as an undergrad. This background can be 
useful, though I've had a lot of catching up to do.
